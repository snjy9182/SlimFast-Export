%% MSD curve for confined motion.
%
% The average MSD curve is enough to assess the confined nature of the

figure
hmsd = ma.plotMeanMSD(gca, true);

%%
% Compare for instance with the curve of the Brownian case. We clearly see
% that the MSD curve can no longer be considered as a straight line. Just
% after a few seconds, the curve saturates, showing that movement on long
% time scales are hindered by some mechanism. 
%
% We can retrieve an *order of magnitude* of the delay needed for the MSD
% curve to show the hindered behavior by a plain ball park analysis: We
% just say that the delay above which confined movement will be prominent
% when the displacement is enough for the elastic spring energy potential
% to be greater than |kT|:
%
% $$ \textrm{E}_\textrm{trap} > kT $$
% 
% $$ \frac{1}{2} \textrm{K}_\textrm{trap} \textrm{d}x^2 > kT $$
%
% but in our case we can approximate |dx² = 4 D t|:
% 
% $$ 2 D t textrm{K}_\textrm{trap} \textrm{d}x^2 > kT $$
%
% $$ t > \frac{kT}{2 \textrm{K}_\textrm{trap} D} $$

fprintf(['Time threshold for confined motion: %.1f ' TIME_UNITS '.\n'], ...

%% 
% Importantly, this means that if you do not sample the particle movements
% over several time this limit, you will not be able to tell diffusive from

%% Fit of the linear part of the MSD.
%
% But we can see that below this limit, the motion is roughly diffusive, as

%%
% The fit yields an acceptable estimate of |D|. It is of course biased
% towards low values, as we might include in the fit points that are below
% the expected straight line.
%
% Paradoxically, the fit would have failed miserably if the sampling
% interval or frame interval |dT| would have been too long (it is rather
% short in this simulation). So for this kind of motion, if we want to
% complete the analysis we need to comply to two competing criterion:
% 
% * the frame interval must be short enough to resolved the diffusive
% motion;
% * the trajectories must be sampled on a time long enough to be able to
% display the confined motion.
%
% Such is the scientist life.

%% Motion type analysis through log-log fitting.
%
% |@msdanalyzer| offers one extra tool to decide whether the observed
% motion is diffusive or of another type. Note that when the motion is
% hindered, the MSD curve is situated below its tangent at |dt=0|, that
% would be the MSD of a purely diffusive motion. Therefore, if we model
% coarsely the MSD curve by a power law 
%
% $$ \textrm{MSD}(t) = \Gamma \times t^\alpha $$
%
% we should get $\alpha=1$ for purely diffusive motion, and $\alpha<1$ for
% confined motion. So we are bound to determine from our experimental
% (simulated) data a power law coefficient. This is best made in a
% |log-log| fashion, for which power laws turn to linear laws:
%
% $$ \textrm{log}(\textrm{MSD}) = \alpha \times \textrm{log}(t) +
% \textrm{log}(\Gamma) $$
% 
% If we fit |log(MSD)| _vs_ |log(t)| by a straight line, we can retrieve
% the value of alpha. 
%
% But before, a quick note on fitting power laws on experimental or
% simulated data: Power laws can only be determined reliably if they are
% sampled over at least 3 orders of magnitude. This means that there must
% be at least a factor of 1000 between the smallest delay and the largest
% one. This is very important, and is frequently abused: power laws are so
% accommodating that you can fit whatever you want given your sampling is
% short enough. In our case, with a frame interval of 50 ms and a sampling
% time of 10 seconds, we are quite not there. Let's try anyway.
%
% There is again a method in |@msdanalyzer| that does it for you:
% |msdanalyzer.fitLogLogMSD|. It does fit individual MSD curve in the
% |log-log| space, and store results in a dedicated field.
%
% Like for the other fitting methods, we can specify a clipping factor
% that only takes a portion of the curves. Since we are already below the 3
% orders of magnitude rule, we will take half of the whole curves:

ma = ma.fitLogLogMSD(0.5);
ma.loglogfit

%%
% We have one fit result per individual particle. We can quickly get a mean
% value for the power law:

mean(ma.loglogfit.alpha)

%% 
% So it looks like it is indeed confined.
%
% We can beautify a bit the analysis, incorporating only results from fit
% that are good enough. The goodness of the fit is represented by its R
% square factor which lies between 0 and 1, the higher the better.

r2fits = ma.loglogfit.r2fit;
alphas = ma.loglogfit.alpha;

R2LIMIT = 0.8;

% Remove bad fits
bad_fits = r2fits < R2LIMIT;
fprintf('Keeping %d fits (R2 > %.2f).\n', sum(~bad_fits), R2LIMIT);
alphas(bad_fits) = [];

% T-test
[htest, pval] = ttest(alphas, 1, 0.05, 'left');

if ~htest
    [htest, pval] = ttest(alphas, 1, 0.05);
end

% Prepare string
str = { [ '\alpha = ' sprintf('%.2f ± %.2f (mean ± std, N = %d)', mean(alphas), std(alphas), numel(alphas)) ] };

if htest
    str{2} = sprintf('Significantly below 1, with p = %.2g', pval);
else
    str{2} = sprintf('Not significantly differend from 1, with p = %.2g', pval);

%% Ordinate at origin of the log-log curve.
%
% The gamma factor in the power law can acutally be linked to the diffusion
% coefficient. Let's see if we can retrieve a better estimate that the one
% we got above through fitting the first part of the MSD curve:

gammas = ma.loglogfit.gamma;
gammas(bad_fits) = []; % discard bad fits, like for alpha

Dmean = mean( gammas ) / 2 / ma.n_dim;
Dstd  =  std( gammas ) / 2 / ma.n_dim;

fprintf('Estimation of the diffusion coefficient from log-log fit of the MSD curves:\n')
fprintf('D = %.2e ± %.2e (mean ± std, N = %d)\n', ...
    Dmean, Dstd, numel(gammas));

%%
% It seems that the estimate through the plain MSD curve fit is less biased
% than the estimate from the fit in the |log-log| space. This is not
% surprising: we fitted the curve by a power law, and there is noting that
% tells us that the real behavior of the MSD curve is actually exactly a
% power law. It is dangerous to blindly relate the |gamma| value we
% inferred to the actual diffusion coefficient. Anyway, the log-log
% technique is only used to determine the kind of motion we deal with.
