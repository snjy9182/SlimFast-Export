  to MSD curves with greater certainty (larger number of elements

%% Brownian motion.
%
% In this part, we simulate plain, 2D diffusive behavior of small particles
% subjected to Brownian motion at a given temperature. They are the most
% easy to simulate, as displacements are totally uncorrelated over time,
% and are distributed following a Gaussian PDF.
%
%% Generating fake trajectories.
%
% Let's first generate a set of trajectories. Here are the simulation
% parameters.

SPACE_UNITS = 'µm';
TIME_UNITS = 's';

N_PARTICLES = 10;
N_TIME_STEPS = 100;
N_DIM = 2; % 2D

% Typical values taken from studies of proteins diffusing in membranes:
% Diffusion coefficient
D  = 1e-3; % µm^2/s
% Time step between acquisition; fast acquisition!
dT = 0.05; % s,

% Area size, just used to disperse particles in 2D. Has no impact on
% analysis.
SIZE = 2; % µm

%%
% Following Einstein equation on the previous page, displacements follow a
% Gaussian PDF with standard deviation given by:

k = sqrt(N_DIM * D * dT);


%%
% Let's generate the tracks. |@msdanalyzer| imposes that the tracks you
% give to it are formatted in the following way: [ Ti Xi Yi ...]. So if we
% generate a track with 50 measurements in a 2D diffusion problem, we must
% generate a 50 x 3 double array per particle.

tracks = cell(N_PARTICLES, 1);

for i = 1 : N_PARTICLES
    
    % Time
    time = (0 : N_TIME_STEPS-1)' * dT;
    
    % Initial position
    X0 = SIZE .* rand(1, N_DIM);
    
    % Integrate uncorrelated displacement
    dX = k * randn(N_TIME_STEPS, N_DIM);
    dX(1, :) = X0;
    X = cumsum(dX, 1);
    
    % Store
    tracks{i} = [time X];
    
end
clear i X dX time X0

%%
% To instantiate the analyzer, we must first provide it with the
% dimensionality of the problem, the space units and the time units. The
% two later arguments are just used for convenience.

ma = msdanalyzer(2, SPACE_UNITS, TIME_UNITS);

%%
% To pass the tracks we created above, we must use |obj = obj.doSomething|
% notation, for |@msdanalyzer| is a per-value class. That is: if you do not
% catch the object returned, your modifications are lost. More precisely:

% This does not work:
ma.addAll(tracks);

% This works:

% Indeed:

%%
% |@msdanalyzer| ships convenience methods to investigate its content. We

% A zoomed version show the stochastic nature of the trajectories. MSD

%
%% Basic analysis.
%
% From there, the MSD analysis is trivial:

ma.msd

%% A note on delays and floating-point accuracy.
%
% Note that the delays are binned together properly. Because of
% floating-point accuracy limit, computing the delays without care would
% generate erroneous curves. For instance, floating point errors would make
% the delay between the 2nd frame and the 1st frame different from the

% is how delays are calculated without taking floating point accuracy limit
% in consideration. If we consider N time-points:

t = (0 : N_TIME_STEPS)' * dT;

%%
% The calculation of all possible delays is the following:

[T1, T2] = meshgrid(t, t);
all_delays = unique( abs(T1 - T2) );

%%
% We expect to have N different delays (0 included), but got:

fprintf('Found %d different delays.\n', numel(all_delays));

%% 
% Some of them look like duplicates:

disp(all_delays(1:9));

%%
% |@msdanalyzer| protects itself against this by having a tolerance for
% binning delays together. This tolerance is by default equal to |10e-12|,
% which is enough to properly circumvent the accuracy problem:

fprintf('For %d time-points, found %d different delays.\n', N_TIME_STEPS, size( ma.msd{1}, 1 ) );


%% Plotting MSD curves.
% 
% To plot the resulting individual MSD curves, use:

figure
ma.plotMSD;

%%
% The plot is quite crowded, and every curve seems to have its own shape.
% We actually need to go one step further, and compute the ensemble mean:
% the average over all curves:

cla
ma.plotMeanMSD(gca, true)

%%
% This method computes the weighted average over all MSD curves. Weights
% are taken to be the number of averaged delay in individual curves, which
% favors short delays. If you need to have a good confidence over larger
% delays, you need to sample particle trajectories for a much longer time.
%
% The grayed area represents the weighted standard
% deviation over all MSD curves. We would like to have a notion of the
% confidence on this mean, such as the standard error of the mean;
% unfortunately there is no consensus as how to define it for weighted
% means. We can approach it using the formula
%
% $$ \textrm{sem} \approx \frac{\textrm{weighted
% std}}{\sqrt{\textrm{N}_\textrm{freedom}}} $$
%
% The method |getMeanMSD| returns a vector with all you need:

help msdanalyzer.getMeanMSD

%%
% So we can plot something like:

mmsd = ma.getMeanMSD;
t = mmsd(:,1);
x = mmsd(:,2);
dx = mmsd(:,3) ./ sqrt(mmsd(:,4));
errorbar(t, x, dx, 'k')

%%
% Just to recapitulate, because now we are doing averages of averages:
%
% * The MSD curves contained in |ma.msd| are already _time-averaged_
%    curves. There is one such curve per particle, and the curve is a
%    characteristic of the particle it is defined for. For each delay |dt|,
%    the square-displacement is averaged over all possible combination of
%    |t1| and |t2| that yields |dt=t2-t1|. And by the way, this is why we
%    call these curves mean square-displacement. And this is also why there
%    is more confidence towards short delays: there are more points in the
%    average than for long delays.
%
% * The mean MSD (a bit of a repetition here) that you get through
%    |ma.getMeanMSD| is the _ensemble average_: It is defined for a set of
%    particles, by taking the weighted mean over all particles for a given
%    delay. It is a characteristic of the dynamical process sampled by the
%    particles. If the particles do not sample the same process, _e.g._ they
%    have different diffusion property, the average MSD curve looses its
%    meaning and relevance.

%% Estimating the diffusion coefficient.
%
% But of course, the only proper way of analyzing this curve is through
% fitting. The following instructions require the curve fitting
% toolbox.

[fo, gof] = ma.fitMeanMSD;
plot(fo)
ma.labelPlotMSD;
legend off

%%
% By default, the fit is only made on the first 25% of the curve, following
% the recommendations of [3]. We may be slightly off depending on your run.
% The R² value is close to 1, indicating that the average MSD curve is
% indeed a line. But since we sampled only 10 particles, we cannot hope to
% have a good confidence on our results.

%%
% Another approach is to fit individual MSD curves and take the mean of the
% resulting parameters. This method |fitMSD| actually updates the object:

ma = ma.fitMSD;

%% 
% We can compute the value for D, taking in the mean the fit results only
% if they were good enough. That is: if their R² is above let's say 0.8:

good_enough_fit = ma.lfit.r2fit > 0.8;
Dmean = mean( ma.lfit.a(good_enough_fit) ) / 2 / ma.n_dim;
Dstd  =  std( ma.lfit.a(good_enough_fit) ) / 2 / ma.n_dim;

fprintf('Estimation of the diffusion coefficient from linear fit of the MSD curves:\n')
fprintf('D = %.3g ± %.3g (mean ± std, N = %d)\n', ...
    Dmean, Dstd, sum(good_enough_fit));

%% Particle velocities
%
% Qian _et al._ [2] (equations 10 & 11) derived a way to estimate the
% diffusion coefficient from the distribution of instantaneous velocities.
% If |v| is the instantaneous velocity vector, then
%
% $$ \textrm{var}(v) = 2 D / \textrm{dT} $$
%
% A word of caution with this expression: Here |v| is the vector itself,
% with several components (two in 2D), not the vector magnitude. For this
% expression to be valid, we must take the variance of one of the vector
% component (|vx| or |vy|). Having several components just yield another
% estimate. Since we are in 2D, we will have two estimates, that we can
% average together to refine the overall estimate:

% Retrieve instantaneous velocities, per track
 trackV = ma.getVelocities;
 
 % Pool track data together
 TV = vertcat( trackV{:} );

 % Velocities are returned in a N x (nDim+1) array: [ T Vx Vy ...]. So the
 % velocity vector in 2D is:
 V = TV(:, 2:3);
 
 % Compute diffusion coefficient
varV = var(V);
mVarV = mean(varV); % Take the mean of the two estimates
Dest = mVarV / 2 * dT;

fprintf('Estimation from velocities histogram:\n')
fprintf('D = %.3g %s, real value was %.3g %s\n', ...
    Dest, [SPACE_UNITS '²/' TIME_UNITS], D, [SPACE_UNITS '²/' TIME_UNITS]);

%% Wrapping up.
%
% This was the most simple  simulations we could run. Particles were in
% small number, they all appeared at the same time and were detected in
% every frame, not missing a single one. In the next parts, we will
% approach other problem types, building up complexity, and use other
% techniques for analysis, still based on the MSD curves.
