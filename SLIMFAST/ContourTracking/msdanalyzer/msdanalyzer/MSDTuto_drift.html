</pre><p>The function to use to pass the drift coordinates is the same whatever the correction method to use: <tt>computeDrift</tt>. You just need to specify a string switch to indicate what one you want to use. In our case, the switch is 'manual', and the function call is the following:</p><pre class="codeinput">ma = ma.computeDrift(<span class="string">'manual'</span>, drift);
</pre><p>You need to assigne the result like this: <tt>ma = ma.something()</tt> because the method updates a field of the object. There are extra options to specify the interpolation method. Again, visit the help page. Here is how to plot the drift as seen by <tt>msdanalyzer</tt></p><pre class="codeinput">ma.plotDrift(ha) <span class="comment">% to plot it in the track figure</span>
</pre><img vspace="5" hspace="5" src="MSDTuto_drift_03.png" alt=""> <p>The interpolated drift array is stored in the <tt>msdanalyzer.drift</tt> field of the object.

</pre><p>This means that it is wiser to feed the particles trajectories with <tt>addAll</tt> first, then feed the drift coordinates.</p><p>Now that the object is given a drift array, it will use it automatically in subsequent calculation. For instance:</p><pre class="codeinput">ma = ma.computeMSD;

D = 9.332e-04 with 95% confidence interval [ 9.276e-04 - 9.389e-04 ].

</pre><p>Now the value we get for <tt>D</tt> is much more accurate. The <tt>log-log</tt> fit is also correct now:</p><pre class="codeinput">ma = ma.fitLogLogMSD;

</pre><p>So everything is now looking good. But of course, this is because we dealt with the trivial case of knowing the exact drift trajectory: We used the same variable to simulate a drift and to correct for it.

Let's see now how to deal with drift when you cannot measure it directly.</p><h2>Particle centroid correction.<a name="15"></a></h2><p>The next two methods can infer drift just from the particle trajectories.

Let's see how it behaves with our current simulation:</p><pre class="codeinput">ma = ma.computeDrift(<span class="string">'centroid'</span>); <span class="comment">% note: no extra parameters.</span>

</pre><p>It seems to work rather well. But let's be frank, this method is the least robust. It greatly depends on the number of particles to be the same at every time point.

%% Visualize drift.
%
% We can use the |@msdanalyzer| class to visualize what we did:

ma = msdanalyzer(2, 'um', 's');
ma = ma.addAll(tracks);
[hps, ha] = ma.plotTracks;
ma.labelPlotTracks

%% A faulty analysis.
% 
% It's rather extreme, as you can see. Let's see what would give an
% inconsiderate analysis:

ma = ma.computeMSD;
figure
ma.plotMeanMSD(gca, true);
ma.fitMeanMSD

%%
% We get a wrong value of |D| and a parabola shape for the beginning of the
% MSD curve, typical of directed motion. The |log-log| analysis we saw
% before is misled as well:

ma = ma.fitLogLogMSD;
r2fits = ma.loglogfit.r2fit;
alphas = ma.loglogfit.alpha;

R2LIMIT = 0.8;

% Remove bad fits
bad_fits = r2fits < R2LIMIT;
fprintf('Keeping %d fits (R2 > %.2f).\n', sum(~bad_fits), R2LIMIT);
alphas(bad_fits) = [];

% Echo results
fprintf('alpha = %.2f ± %.2f (mean ± std, N = %d).\n', ...
    mean(alphas), std(alphas), numel(alphas));

%%
% We get an alpha value close to 2, again typical of directed motion, which
% is completely wrong.

%% Dealing with known drift.
%
% The easiest way to deal with drift is to assume you know perfectly what
% it is quantitatively. This lucky situation arises when you managed to
% track an immobile particle during the acquisition, typically a very
% large bead firmly attached to the sample carrier.
%
% In that case, you can feed this drift trajectory to |@msdanalyzer|, and
% it will correct the other trajectories with it. |@msdanalyzer| can
% interpolate missing drift data points, as lonf as they are "inside" the
% drift trajectory. If the drift is sampled between |t1| and |t2|, it
% cannot correct for particles that are sampled at |t<t1| or |t>t2|. I
% leave you to read the help section (|help msdanalyzer.computeDrift|) for
% details.
%
% You need to feed the drift coordinates formatted like for tracks: a
% double array arranged as |[ Ti Xi Yi ... ]|. In our simulation, that
% would be the |drift| variable. Let's erase 10% of its data points, to see
% how |@msdanalyzer| manages:

to_erase = rand( size(drift,1), 1) < 0.1;
to_erase(1, end) = false; % ensure we do not erase the last and first ones
drift(to_erase, :) = [];

%%
% The function to use to pass the drift coordinates is the same whatever
% the correction method to use: |computeDrift|. You just need to specify a
% string switch to indicate what one you want to use. In our case, the
% switch is 'manual', and the function call is the following:

ma = ma.computeDrift('manual', drift);

%% 
% You need to assigne the result like this: |ma = ma.something()| because
% the method updates a field of the object. There are extra options to
% specify the interpolation method. Again, visit the help page. Here is how
% to plot the drift as seen by |msdanalyzer|

ma.plotDrift(ha) % to plot it in the track figure

%%
% The interpolated drift array is stored in the |msdanalyzer.drift| field
% of the object. Notice that we have here the interpolated value for all
% the common time point of the particle trajectories:

size(drift) % measured drift

%%
size(ma.drift) % interpolated drift

%%
% This means that it is wiser to feed the particles trajectories with
% |addAll| first, then feed the drift coordinates.
%
% Now that the object is given a drift array, it will use it automatically
% in subsequent calculation. For instance:

ma = ma.computeMSD;
ma.fitMeanMSD

%%
% Now the value we get for |D| is much more accurate. The |log-log| fit is
% also correct now:

ma = ma.fitLogLogMSD;
r2fits = ma.loglogfit.r2fit;
alphas = ma.loglogfit.alpha;

R2LIMIT = 0.8;

% Remove bad fits
bad_fits = r2fits < R2LIMIT;
fprintf('Keeping %d fits (R2 > %.2f).\n', sum(~bad_fits), R2LIMIT);
alphas(bad_fits) = [];

% Echo results
fprintf('alpha = %.2f ± %.2f (mean ± std, N = %d).\n', ...
    mean(alphas), std(alphas), numel(alphas));

%%
% So everything is now looking good. But of course, this is because we
% dealt with the trivial case of knowing the exact drift trajectory: We
% used the same variable to simulate a drift and to correct for it. Real
% experimental measures might not be so ideal. Let's see now how to deal
% with drift when you cannot measure it directly.

%% Particle centroid correction.
%
% The next two methods can infer drift just from the particle trajectories.
% Given of course that they are in sufficient number, and sampled properly.
% The |centroid| method simply computes the average position over all
% particles at each time point, and treat this as the drift position. Let's
% see how it behaves with our current simulation:

ma = ma.computeDrift('centroid'); % note: no extra parameters.
ma = ma.computeMSD;
ma.fitMeanMSD

%% 
% It seems to work rather well. But let's be frank, this method is the
% least robust. It greatly depends on the number of particles to be the
% same at every time point. As soon as there is missing detections,
% particle trajectories starting or finishing at different time points, it
% fails. Check this simulation, where we treat these cases:

close all
clear all

% Probability to miss a detection.
P_GAPS = 0.25; 

N_PARTICLES = 300; % 1000
N_TIME_STEPS = 200;

drift = [ drift_time drift_pos];

% Tracks generation

for i_spot = 1 : N_PARTICLES
    
    % Time: each particle is detected for a random duration, starting from
    % a random time.
    time_steps = 10 + max(1, round(N_TIME_STEPS/2 + N_TIME_STEPS/4*randn));
    time = (0 : time_steps-1)' * dT + dT * floor(N_TIME_STEPS / 4  * rand);
    time ( time >= max(drift_time) ) = []; % delete data not within drift range
    time = msdanalyzer.roundn(time, 3); % Avoid floating point accuracy problems imperfectly
    
    % Initial position
    X0 = SIZE .* rand(1, N_DIM);
    
    % Integrate uncorrelated displacement
    dX = k * randn(numel(time), N_DIM);
    dX(1, :) = X0;
    X = cumsum(dX, 1);
    
    % Add drift 
    % This is hack to retrieve automatically in a vectorized
    % fashion all the time indices in the drift vector that are in the
    % position vector.
    [~, index_in_drift_time, index_in_time] = intersect(drift_time, time);
    X = X + drift_pos(index_in_drift_time, :);
  
    % Simulate missing frames
    missing_frames = rand(numel(time), 1) < P_GAPS;
    X(missing_frames, :) = [];
    time(missing_frames) = [];
    
    % Store
    tracks{i_spot} = [ time X];
    
end

ma = msdanalyzer(2, 'um', 's');
ma = ma.addAll(tracks);

%%
% The tracks are much more messy. Let's see what drift we can infer from
% them:

ma = ma.computeDrift('centroid');
figure
ma.plotDrift
ma.labelPlotTracks

%%
% We are indeed likely to expose ourselves to troubles with this method.
% The drift calculated is clearly far from what we expect, notably at the
% beginning of the track and at its end, where these is the smallest number
% of particles. This is confirmed numerically:

ma = ma.computeMSD;
figure
ma.plotMeanMSD(gca, true)
ma.fitMeanMSD

%%
% This is completely wrong.
%
% So this method is a little bit like a toy: it works only for cases that
% are seldom seen experimentally. You would need to have the same particles
% detected at the same times, with no detection missing. 

%% Drift correction using velocity correlation.
%
% The following method corrects these problems, using a simple observation.
% Since we are dealing with homogeneous drift, the displacement due to the
% drift will be the same for all particles at any given point. On top of
% this common displacement, each particle will undergo a displacement due
% to the Brownian motion, which we are trying to sample. If we write this
% with equations, we get for the velocity if the |i|th particle:
%
% $$ \textbf{v}_i(t) = \textbf{v}_\textrm{drift}(t) + \textbf{v}_{i,
% \textrm{diffusive}}(t) $$
%
% If we now average over all particles at fixed time _|t|_:
%
% $$ \left< \textbf{v} \right>(t) = \frac{1}{N(t)} \sum_i \left(
% \textbf{v}_\textrm{drift} + \textbf{v}_{i,\textrm{diffusive}} \right) $$
%
% But the diffusive movement of the particles are uncorrelated from one
% particle to another. If the particles are in a great enough number, we
% can therefore assume that the second term in the sum will cancel to 0.
% Since the first term in the sum does not depend on _|i|_, we can write:
% 
% $$ \textbf{v}_\textrm{drift}(t) = \left< \textbf{v} \right>(t) $$ 
%
% To infer the _displacement_ due to the drift, we simply integrate this
% velocity over time:
%
% $$ \textbf{x}_\textrm{drift}(t) = \int_0^t \left< \textbf{v} \right>(t')
% \textrm{d}t' $$
%
% Let's see how it works in practice:


ma = ma.computeDrift('velocity');
figure
ma.plotDrift
ma.labelPlotTracks

%%
% This looks way better. The drift resembles what we could infer from the
% tracks. If we quantify the error in the drift estimation, we get:

error = drift(1:N_TIME_STEPS/2, 2:3) - ma.drift(1:N_TIME_STEPS/2, 2:3);
std(error) % µm

%%
% We make a localization mistake of about 20 nm each time. The problem is
% that this is of the same order of magnitude than the typical particle
% movement |k|. We must therefore expect still some discrepancy in the
% numerical estimates. Still:

ma = ma.computeMSD;
figure
ma.plotMeanMSD(gca, true)
ma.fitMeanMSD

%%
% The results are well acceptable. I have found out that this method is
% relatively robust, as soon as you have enough particles to average. So on
% top of sampling their motion on short time scales for long durations, we
% must also acquire plenty of them at once, to be able to correct well for
% drift.

%% Non-homogeneous drift.
%
% When you image live cells in fluorescence microscopy, a high illumination
% power will damage them. Most of the time they will shrink, which will
% create a drift of the particles towards the center of the cell. This
% drift is non-homogeneous: each particle has a difference drift velocity
% vector. I have no good way to deal with this case, for this drift is not
% distinguishable from a directed movement of the particles towards the
% center of the cell. So to the list of requirements for a proper image
% acquisition needed for MSD analysis, we must also add imaging conditions
% that are non phototoxic, that is: low light.
% 
% Such is the scientist life....
